### Issue: grab area to resize windows is very small

This happens because in Xfwm the grab area is defined by the theme. There exists an open [bug report](https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11808) that is open since mid 2015. The easiest workaround apart from changing the theme is to use the combination `Alt + Right Click` to resize the windows.
